Our game oVRcooked is a cooperative cooking simulator.
Two players have to work together to complete as many of the randomly generated orders before the time runs out.
To achieve this one has to first gather ingredients from the ingredient spawners. A chopping board allows the user
to easily carry multiple ingredients at the same time. The vegetables have to be chopped using a knife, 
while the meat has to be chopped and then cooked. But be careful not to burn it! The prepared ingredients finally need to
be combined on a plate according to the orders and submitted at the counter to score. Locomotion is provided using
a traditional teleportation method and a dash movement gesture. Our interactions techniques are focussed on grabbing and throwing like
in the inspirational game overcooked. Noteworthy is also the menu which uses post processing to blue the background and renders
the menu and hands on top of everything else using a secondary camera.

We implemented the following choice features:
Particle systems
	2 particle systems are used on the teleportation recticle
	3 particle systems are used to form the fire that heats the pans
Custom shaders
	A custom shader is used for the teleportation recticle from a cylinder
	Another one is used to show the progress of preparing ingredients
Teleportation
	A XRRayInteractor with a curved ray and a custom recticle was used
Networked object passed from hand to hand
	This was implemented using XRGrabInteractables

We generally used the components from the XR Interaction Toolkit and extended them.
The models were mostly made ourselves with a few exceptions (see folder structure)
