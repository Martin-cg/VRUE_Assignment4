We implemented the following bonus features:

Group operations with objects:
It is possible to put multiple objects onto a chopping board and carry them around as a group.
This is implemented by using an XRSocketInteractor and a Trigger on each side of the board. Once an interactable enters
one of them its current position is used as an attach point that holds until taken off again.
The board can be moved around as one wishes while holding ingredients.
The user can also combine prepared ingredients on a plate to submit an order. This is done similar to the chopping board
but also uses presets made up of a hidden hierachy, which defines what ingredients in what state and how the objects should be arranged.
Additionally, meat can be put into a pan, which in turn can be put onto a stove to cook the meat (once prepared).

Locomotion metaphor:
Like in the original Overcooked it is possible to perform a dash by swinging both arms backwards at the same time.
The distance and time travelled is dependent on the velocity of the performed gesture.
